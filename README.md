## Documentation

This game was built based on the customtkinter and pygame documentation

<br />

## Converting to Executable

PyInstaller is a popular tool that allows you to convert Python scripts into standalone executable files for various
platforms, effectively creating desktop applications.

- You can use PyInstaller options to customize the behavior and appearance of the generated executable. Refer to the
  PyInstaller documentation for more information on available options.
- Keep in mind that PyInstaller generates a self-contained executable, but the size of the executable might be larger
  due
  to the inclusion of the Python interpreter and any dependencies, it's best to use venv to make sure only packages used
  in the
  project are included.
- Be sure to test the generated executable on the
  target platform to ensure everything works as expected.

<br />

> Install modules via `VENV`

```bash
$ virtualenv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

<br />

> Create the .exe file

```bash
$ pyinstaller main.spec 
```
